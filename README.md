# GradesApp

## Desctiption
"GradesApp" is a simple application for adding student grades, available in two languages: English and Polish. 
First you choose the language, then you choose where you want to save the grades: in a file or in the program memory. 
Next you can add grades, which can be added as numbers from 1 to 6 or grades with '+' or '-'. You can also add grades in multiples of 0.5 or 0,5 (e.g. 4.5 or 4,5).
If you add an incorrect grade, you will receive an appropriate message.
If you finish adding grades, you will see statistics counted based on the grades you added.
